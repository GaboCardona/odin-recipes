        <p>This is the best turkey burger recipe. After making them the first time my husband said 'no more' to beef burgers. These are really good - any cooking method may be used, and they freeze very well. The recipe can also be used for meatballs or meatloaves.</p>

        <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2> <!-- This is the ingredients list -->

            <li>3 pounds ground turkey</li>
