        <p>This homemade sushi is so simple and fun to make! It is definitely sushi for those who may be nervous to try sushi! This also makes a great appetizer and my whole family loves them! Most of these ingredients can be found in your local supermarket and the result is yum-yum-yum! Serve with a bowl of soy sauce and a lump of wasabi.</p>
